### Hardware

* Raspberry Pi Zero 2 WH (20-23 €)
* 32 Gb MicroSD-Card (Higher end, 10 - 15 €)
* [Waveshare 400x300 4.2inch E-Ink display module, three-color](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/epaper-2/4.2inch-e-paper-module-b.htm?___SID=U) (35 - 45 €)
* 2x M3*12 screws (conic head)

### Setting up the Linux system

Install the "Raspberry Pi OS (other)" -> "Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)", ideally through the Raspberry Pi Imager

`sudo apt install git ...`
